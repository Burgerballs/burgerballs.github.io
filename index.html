		<div class="minibox">
			<div style="margin: 4px">
				Hai everyone! It's me! Myceli! I'm one of those evil programmer musician folk
				and I worked on a couple projects, mainly FNF ones tho.<br/><br/>
				As of 19/9/2025 (dd/mm/yyyy), I'm currently working on Bub's Fruit Salad & Fatal Files!<br/>
				<small>Historically I've worked on Kero & Catfight just to name a few!</small>

		<h1>"What do you even like???" (Interests)</h1>
		<div class="minibox">
			<div style="margin: 4px">
				My interests are that of the usual twittermonger, with a few extras
				scattered in there I guess. A little bit of UTDR, some Geometry Dash,
				some FNF, a little more recently I've also gotten into Homestuck which
				I hope scares some people!<br/><br/>
				Some less promenant interests that you probably won't have a chance of
				seeing me mention in public are things like LittleBigPlanet, Fortnite, and some rhythm games like Etterna!

		<div class="minibox">
			<div style="margin: 4px">
				Just don't be racist homophobic transphobic and shit, and I know the chances may be slim
				but if any kidlikers see this page I hope they burn, I curse you with Eternal Flame!!
				<br/><br/>
				Also do not be one of those people who hate polyamorous folk, you guys are just repackaging homophobia
				into something you have less of a chance to be yelled at for.
